**DevOps**

It is a contraction process of replacing the whole process lifecycle replacing the unified Development and Operations. The essential practices consists of agile planning, continuous development, continuous integration, continuous delivery and monitoring of the applications. This include reduction and shorten of your overall cycle time, Using more amount of automation, Increasing your deployment frequency. This also has the overall value of inprovement over the whole process.

**DevOps Journey**

- Continuous Integration allows you to have merging and testing of code, allowing you to find the defects and issues on the go.
- Continuous Delivery of the solutions making it to the testing and production environments, this also helps in fixing the bugs and in response to the ever changing business requirements.
- Version Control lets you communicate effectively during the daily developent activities with its features like integration with other software development tools.
- Agile methodologies can be used in place to Plan and Isolate the work around the sprints, Managing the overall team capacity which lets you to easily scale the needs of business at the times.
- Monitoring and Logging of your Running applications, which includes the application healh, customer usage of different environments like DEV, QAT, UAT or PROD ones. This helps companies to forecast and quickly validate or disapprove the strategy. In this way you can refine and use this rich data at multiple places in your organization.
- Public or Hybrid Cloud models that can make this whole DevOps model a seamless cycle, Using the clouds has removed the overall classic bottlenecks, You can make use of the infrastructure as a service(IaaS) to lift and shift your existing applications or make use of Platform as a Service to gain the overall productivity. The cloud gives you immense potential without the limits.
- Insfrastructure as Code (IaC): This tech lets you to automate your creation and termination of environments with a proper validaton that gives you a overall secure and stable application in your hosting platforms.
- You can also breakdown your applications into microservices which lets you to isolate your business into small reusable services. This architecture enables your overall scalability and efficiency.
- Containers are the blessings of virtualization: These are light-weight virtual machines, that allows you for faster movement and easy configuration of files.

**Organization Structure for Agile Practices**

When the work of reorganizing comes for organozation it becomes a tedeous task to do so, as this requires both mind-shift and culture-shift that becomes the main challenge, due to the existing policies and processes of the organization. In sopme big organization it becomes a bit of headache as it creates many relatively rigid rules, operating structures and methods, which also tend to avoid a broad delegation of authority.

When large organizations move towards the agile structure, their business environments becomes very volatite or unstable and complex at the same time as they move ahead of the limitations of current systems, which can be mainly the cope to change quickly.

**Horizontal vs. Vertical Teams**

*Horizontal Team:* This is a kind of team where you will find a team is assigned based of the software architecture, For example here we have five team:

- Data Team: The data team will be working on all the data based functionalities of the application.
- Software Architecture Team: The Software Architecture team will be working on designing the architecture for various functionalities of the application.
- UI/UX Team: The UI/UX team will be working on all the UI/UX to create user friendly interfaces for various functionalities of the application.
- Backend Development Team: The backend team will be working on development of API's, adding the logics, integrating the payment gateways and so on for various functionalities of the application.
- Frontend Development Team: The Frontend team will be working on implementing the pages, Payment Options, handeling the email interactions and so on for various functionalities of the application.

*Vertical Team:* In the vertical teams is structured in a way that a specific product or the areas of software development can be asssigned with wholesome of individuals with diverse skils from start to end of the SDLC.

Vertical teams are great performer as there is an end-to-end ownership in the project where each product is defined by its product owner. They also have increased efficiency due to less amount of handoffs leading to faster development process. This way vertical teams are more likely to be cross-functional and Delivery Focused as it value more due to concentrated focus on the specific features.

**Azure DevOps**

Azure DevOps is a solution from Microsoft that gives an end to end devops life-cycle toolchain for developing and deploying software. These wholesome of the services provided by Microsoft consists of tools like :

- Azure Boards: This is similar to your Jira Board which lets you to track your work the help of Kanban Boards, Backlogs, Team dashboards while integrating with some of your favorite tools like Github, Jenkins.

- Azure Pipelines: This service allows you to have cloud hosted pipelines for multiple kind of applications. You can also deploy your applications to cloud or on-prem environments

- Azure Repos: This service is same like Github with all the tools at a single place, where you can push or pull your code, create new repositories. You can also collaborate with multiple users in the repos.

- Azure Artifacts: This service lets you to create and share Maven, npm, Python or Rust packages from public as well as private sources. This also lets your artifacts organized and managed.

- Azure Test Plans: This is a service that lets you to improve your code quality using the planned and exploratory testing services for your applications.

**GitHub**

Github is a platform as a service (PaaS) that lets you store the code in form of code repositories and has the necessary tools for developing or deploying software.

GitHub provide you services like:

- CodeSpace (A Cloud hosted development environment based on Microsoft Visual Code) which can be used or operated from anywhere. This helps a lot in Cross Platform Development.

- Repos or Repositories: These are like the bookshelfs or containers which is used to store code.

- Actions: These are used to create automation workflows. This consists of scripts which lets them perform any jobs like including CI/CD or more of Actions is a recipe maker for your github repositories.

- Packages: Github Package is a software package hosting service that allows you to host your software packages privately and use them over your projects.

**GitHub Projects**

A Github Project is a flexible tool provided by Github to manage the overall activities and making them work in a very efficient way. Github Projects allows you to make projects based on templates like the Team Planning, Feature Release, Kanban, Bug Tracker, Iterative Development, Product Launch, Roadmap, Team Retrospective and Options like Table, Board, Roadmap to start from scratch.
